This is my very first attempt at creating a REST API!!!

I uesed node.js, express, and mongoDB and for my IDE I used VScode.

To create this REST API I followed along with this Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgTGADljAeg

This repository contains code demonstrating Rest API with GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE requests samples.
